# Music Releases
This project is our first dive into REACT and what a pleasure...
The goal was to create components by using data from Spotify and build a landing page which shows new album and single releases with a predetermined design for all elements. All done in pair programming. 

## The problem
We looked through the given material for this project, read through internets do's and dont't's and started coding together on liveserver. Started of by creating components for the functions we needed and made it too complicated for ourselves.
Installing Linters helped us with a lot of problemshooting. We also used Stack Overflow & google to find our way. Our biggest problem was connecting all components we created into app.js in the way we wanted.
If we had more time we would try the stretch goals.
